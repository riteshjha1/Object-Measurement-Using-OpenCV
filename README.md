**Real-time object detection and measurement is the task of detecting object and computing its dimensions by maintaining a base level of accuracy.**<br>

 We tried to eliminate the need of manually measuring the dimensions of objects and automated the process.<br>

 It is time saving and as good as manually measurements, the **average acuracy we achieved is 97%**.<br>
 And the requirements of this projeect is very less, all you need is a webcam, white A4 size sheet, python, OpenCv and numpy installed on your system and you are good to go, now all you have to do is run the code and put the object in it's field of vision and viola you have your dimensions.
